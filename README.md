Time series analysis refers to the process of analyzing and modeling data that is collected and recorded over time, typically at regular intervals. It focuses on understanding the patterns, trends, and characteristics of the data to make predictions and draw insights about future behavior.

Time series data is different from other types of data because it has a temporal component, meaning that each observation is associated with a specific time point or interval. Examples of time series data include stock prices, weather measurements, sales data, sensor readings, and economic indicators.

The goals of time series analysis can vary depending on the specific application, but they often include the following:

* Descriptive Analysis: Describing the patterns and trends in the data over time, such as identifying seasonal variations, trends, cycles, or irregular fluctuations. This involves visualizing the data, calculating summary statistics, and exploring relationships between variables.

* Forecasting: Predicting future values or events based on the historical patterns observed in the data. This can be done using various statistical and machine learning techniques to capture the underlying patterns and make predictions with a certain level of confidence.

To conduct time series analysis, various techniques and models can be employed, including statistical methods like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing, and state space models, as well as machine learning algorithms like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Prophet.
